VERSION HISTORY

    v0.9.5 - 04-17-2024

        - added labels on fibo axis following the price and giving %gain on C to N (won't matter on other structures than N-Waves yet)
        - added Taito Suchi indicator
            o added Correlation to Ichimoku numbers (+1/-1 of any Kihon Suchi number, or natural in 26 periods) as bottom right box message
            o added a box message in top right corner if ab = bc or bc = cd
        - fixed the labels around the E-Box
        - improved the correction prediction for E-Box
        - improved the documentation

    v0.9.4 - 04-06-2024

        - added the case of A/B/C is the beginning of an S-Wave (more than 100% of BC retracement over AB)
        - added P Target as B + (A - C), instead of an Nt one, displayed when having a P-Wave structure using A/B/C/D (>50% retracement)
        - added an option to specify the % of retracement needed for a P-Wave (N-Wave and P-Wave have a blurry area)
        - added a box to point E based on CLogik's approach using a potentially realised D point : 
            o still has many bugs if not in a positive N-Wave,
            o and it won't display anything within an S-Wave
        - added an option to add the price to the label at each A/B/C/D point
        - added vertical extended lines to the Kihon Suchi series that : 
            o can start from the last tenkan crossover/crossunder time (as period 1 in the series)
            o can start from B time (as period 1 in the series)
        - added an option to draw the A/B/C/D trendlines (D has to be visible)
        - added an option to draw the A+26 periods dateline (and the C+26 one)
        - found a gremlin who messed with the calculus of the multiples of N and E arrows
        - fixed an oopsie on the Tenkan Crossover limiting amount of labels 
        - fixed the limitation of the total amount of labels displayed by the indicator to 100
        - fixed the number of bars between A and B and C (the number in the "above the bar" label was not including A in the count)
        - fixes and many typos
        - removed dead code
